Beginnings of a tank game like Scorched Earth or Worms, built with Unity in 3D.  It was going to be a game where tanks launch missiles to try to hit each other by orbiting around planets, but I only ever had time to finish the planet generator.

Note that this is only the code and if you were to build this project, you'd have to use your own Unity project, assets, scenes, and Unity Store purchases.
