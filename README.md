Beginnings of a tank game like Scorched Earth or Worms, built with Unity in 3D.  It was going to be a game where tanks launch missiles to try to hit each other by orbiting around planets, but I only ever had time to finish the planet generator.

Note that if you were to try to build this project, you would have to provide your own texture assets.  I used downloaded assets which I cannot include in the repo.
